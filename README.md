# ThinkShift Web Application

ThinkShift is a web application with the purpose of making it easier and streamlining the process for managers to create shifts and assign timetables for employees. This app was created with small to medium sized businesses in mind. We decided upon this idea from both of our experiences in the retail/service industry and felt this was an area that could be improved. The app is essentially split into two different views, that of the manager and also that of the employee. In this user guide we will describe the functionality for both types of users.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
